# Overview:

This is a basic implementation of a simple chatbot in Python. 
The chatbot is designed to perform the following functions:

Responds to at least five basic questions.
Includes a farewell message.
Previous Context:
Remembers previous interactions.
Recalls and references the context of the conversation.

# User Interaction:

Engages the user by asking three questions.
Reacts to user responses accordingly.

# Error Handling:

Implements basic error handling for scenarios where the chatbot does not understand the user's input.
Provides a friendly response in such cases.


# Usage:

The chatbot will greet you and ask three questions.
Provide responses to the questions asked by the chatbot.
The chatbot will remember your responses and provide feedback.

# Customization:

Feel free to customize the chatbot by modifying the code:
Add more questions and responses.

# Future Improvements:
This project can be expanded by:
